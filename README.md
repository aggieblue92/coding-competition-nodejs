Framework for hosting coding competitions using Node.JS

Currently, the framework is very under development. There are working copies on the master branch under the commit 0.2
(Goron). It may be tricky to get running, but it's what we used at my university for our last coding competition
and it worked like a charm.

Development is happening on this branch from now on.

I'm working to on the third iteration of the framework, using Node.js, Express.js, Angular.js, Jade, and MySQL.

Development on this third iteration began March 30th, 2015. It was being actively developed June 6th, 2015.
If the current date is much later than that, then I'm sorry that this project has become stale. Version 0.2 worked as of
March 2015 very smoothly, just make sure that you have all the required technologies (g++, java, etc.)
installed to use the actual submission server.
