-------------- TODO LIST --------------

-- Redo user system
-- Add admin functions
+++ Competition, users, problems, test cases
-- Static content generation (About page, index page, rules page)

-------------- REDO USER SYSTEM --------------

Right now, the user system is per individual user. Every user registers with a username, tagline, password, and email address. The model for registration that the USU ACM leadership has proposed is very different. The new model should follow these guidelines:

Every team is attached to a competition, with a maximum number of teammates (specified per competition). Each team can have up to N users attached to it. Users can be re-used (drawn from existing user pool), or created inline on the team registration page. If a team does not have enough users to fill their team capacity, they are given the option to notify the admins that they are willing to take on more teammates. The admins will, at the beginning of the competition, ask small groups (1 or 2 people) without teams to wait at the front, and we will match small teams to people looking for teams.

Each team has the following information:
-- To which competition it is attached
-- A team name (replaces 'user name' that is shown on submission pages)
-- A tagline for the team (replaces 'tagline' that is shown on submission pages)
-- Whether or not they are willing to fill empty spots with people looking for teams (only if their team is not filled)

Each user has the following information:
-- User name
-- Password (can be reused)
-- Email address
-- Whether or not contact information can be shared with sponsors (for recruiting purposes ONLY - we do have an agreement, so it is strongly recommended to allow sharing of contact information)


-------------- Add Admin Functions --------------

Right now, when an admin logs in, they are presented with the same pages the users see, except their sidebars are filled with dead links to admin function pages. We need these functions:

Competitions
-- Create a new competition. Requires:
-- -- Competition Name
-- -- Start and End date and time
-- -- Is Private? (Public competitions are visible to guests after they finish)
-- -- HTML main page - main competition page to show on accessing competition.
-- Modify competition
-- -- Add problem to competition (only for valid problems)
-- Add problem. Requires:
-- -- Problem Name
-- -- Problem Description file upload
-- -- Problem description type (choose PDF, HTML, PNG, TXT)
-- -- Default time limit (applies to all languages, unless otherwise specified)
-- -- Source code that solves problem (MUST compile! MUST run!)
-- -- Will not be active or useable until at least one test case is added
-- Modify problem, remove problem
-- Add test case. Requires:
-- -- Test case input
-- -- Test case output
-- -- Test cases will be ran against source code that solves problem (provided by problem creator), and if they fail in the system, they will not be accepted.
-- -- Use same subsystem that regular submissions use.
-- Remove test case
Users
-- Modify user data
-- Remove user
-- Add user to team
