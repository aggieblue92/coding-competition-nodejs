{"name":"Indigo-code","tagline":"Framework for hosting coding competitions using Node.JS","body":"### Indigo Code\r\nThe Indigo Code project was born because at the university I studied at, we wanted to put on a coding competition but didn't have a framework on which to host a competition. We wanted more control over the competition than CodeChef, and we had the know-how to create an open source solution, and so we did. And here it is!\r\n\r\nThe project is still under development, version 0.3.1 (Zora) is being developed currently.\r\n\r\nCheck back later for updates, I'll update this page as soon as a working version is available. In the meantime, version 0.2 (Goron) is what we used for our coding competition, and it worked quite well. There's one elusive bug in registration, but otherwise it works like a charm. You can try your hand at it if you please.\r\n\r\n-Kamaron Peterson\r\n@sessamekesh","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
