In here, I'm going to put notes that I want to refer to later during development, but don't belong in the use case
diagrams, database diagrams, flowcharts, and what have you. This should all end up in comments too.

-------------------- Competition Assets --------------------

Competition descriptions are provided as a .jade file, and are located under /views/competition/descriptions/:id.jade
Likewise, the rules are provided under /views/competition/rules/:id.jade

A CompetitionDescription model is passed to the description file, and a CompetitionRules model is passed to the rules file.

Any variables available in them may be used by the description writer.

Also, .jade files will typically only extend the "content" block, though they may modify other elements as well.
