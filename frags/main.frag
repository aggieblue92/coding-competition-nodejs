<h1>Framework Tests/Prototype</h1>

<p>This is a prototype of the coding competition framework in development for use by the USU ACM chapter in their programming competitions. The entire implementation is done in Node.JS.</p>

<hr>

<p>The plan is to have a completely modular framework design that can be extended and modified,
allowing future ACM leadership to use the framework 'as-is' or to add their own features as well. Or, if the 'features' included in this version are true to what 'features' usually means, they can be easily removed as well.</p>

<p>The competitions can be accessed and modified at any time by any admin. Each competition can also be accessed during its allotted time by any user. After the time of the competition has passed, if it was a public competition, even general users can access the questions and scoreboard.</p>

<p>Practice problems are provided for users, so they can get used to using the framework.</p>

<p>During the competition, problems are provided with:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A problem description</li>
	<li>Sample input/output files</li>
	<li>Test cases (not visible to users)</li>
	<li>A submit option</li>
</ul>

<p>Anyways. I'll try to put up a development guide as well.</p>
