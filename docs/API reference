ZORA PROTOTYPE REST API

    The Zora web framework provides a REST api for interaction with the server. This is used on the front-end for
much of the content and navigation code, and is also exposed for users to handle into. The API is independent of front-end
functions, so a custom front-end could be built on top of the API layer if desired. All of the functionality
to run a coding competition (with the exception of the submission server itself) is provided in the API. In essence,
if there is a valid submission server running and attached to the API, the API could be used by itself. The front-end
in this project is simply the front-end that we have used at USU for our coding competitions.

    The Zora API is split into the following main sections:

competition_api
team_api
user_api

    Documentation for each individual API are as follows:

---------------------- competition_api ----------------------

---------------------- user_api ----------------------
