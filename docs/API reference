ZORA PROTOTYPE REST API

    The Zora web framework provides a REST api for interaction with the server. This is used on the front-end for
much of the content and navigation code, and is also exposed for users to handle into. While for the USU competitions
I cannot condone the writing of custom user scripts and web frontends to reach the competition website and submission
server, the freedom will exist. User statistics will be available, and this is the idea behind exposing the API -
a user could create a web banner containing recent competition details (for CS department websites, etc.), a mobile
app that reports scores and submissions, etc.

    All API calls will fit under the directory /api. These calls are as follows, and are documented as such:

    HTTP-VERB /api/[system/]call[?param1=value&param2=value] NOTES
